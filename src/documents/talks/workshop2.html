<h2>Introduction to Application Automation with Habitat</h2>
<p>
<strong>Instructor: </strong>
TBD
</p>
<p>
<strong>Abstract</strong>
<br/>
Habitat is a new approach to automation that focuses on the application instead of the infrastructure it runs on. With Habitat, the apps you build, deploy, and manage behave consistently in any runtime — bare metal, VMs, containers, and PaaS. You'll spend less time on the environment and more time building features.
<br/><br/>
This workshop will provide attendees with the knowledge of how to package and run applications with Habitat. At the end of this workshop attendees will understand Habitat's packaging technology, how to package an existing application with Habitat, the benefits of the Habitat studio, how the Habitat supervisor works to provides application focused automation, and how to run applications using Habitat.
<br/><br/>

<strong>Workshop Requires:</strong>
<br/>
Attendees should bring a wifi-enabled laptop to the workshop. The following operating systems have been tested as workstation systems with the hands on exercises:
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Ubuntu 12.04+
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Mac OS X 10.7.3+
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Windows 7+
<br/><br/>
Other platforms and platform versions may work without modification. Due to time constraints we will not be able to troubleshoot issues with unlisted platforms.
<br/><br/>

Attendees will be given a remote workstation with all pre-requisites installed. The only thing requiered to access these workstations will be an SSH client (PuTTY on Windows) and familiarity with a interactive text editor (Vi/Vim, Emacs, or Nano).
<br/><br/>

Attendees working on a Mac or Linux workstation may run all of the labs locally by following the instructions to Get Habitat as listed on the Habitat website.
<br/><br/>

It's best that students of this class have some familiarity and comfort with the following:
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Writing code (of just about any flavor) in a text editor
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Working on the command line
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Basic system administration – installing packages, configuring those packages, starting service
