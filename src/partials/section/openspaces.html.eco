<h3>What are OpenSpaces?</h3>
<p>
    OpenSpace is a small set of rules that allow groups of people to interact in 
    a simple, productive, organized way to create valuable dialogs that address 
    the participants' most important issues.
</p>
<p>
    The Fundamental "Rules" of the sessions that happen during OpenSpace 
    conferences are:
    <div class="openspaces">
    <ul>
        <li>Whoever shows up is the right group</li>
        <li>Whatever happens is the only thing that could have</li>
        <li>Whenever it starts is the right time</li>
        <li>When it's over, it's over.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</p>

    To Lead an OpenSpace Talk:
    <div class="openspaces">
    <ul>
        <li>Come up with an interesting topic and title for your discussion. 
            While many ideas will be spontaneous, we want to encourage 
            people to come with some preparation and thoughts on hands on
            activities. AV will be provided in at least two of the spaces.</li>
        <li>Fill out a schedule Post-It for your topic.</li>
        <li>Place the topic on the schedule.</li>
        <li>If you see topics that have something in common, consider 
            combining them into a single time slot.</li>
        <li>If a significant number of people want to attend your discussion 
            and another discussion in the same time slot, try to 
            trade into another time slot to ensure maximum dialog and 
            participation.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    To Attend an OpenSpace Talk
    <div class="openspaces">
    <ul>
        <li>Check the schedule and sign up for a talk or just drop in 
            if you wish</li>
        <li>Use the 'Law of two feet.' If you feel that you are not 
            contributing or benefiting from a presentation, please feel 
            free to move on to something else.</li>
        <li>Allow the discussion convener to steer his or her topic. 
            If you have an opposing opinion that needs a full time slot 
            you should feel free to add your own OpenSpace slot to discuss 
            the topic.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
