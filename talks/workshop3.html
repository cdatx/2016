<strong>Abstract</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
Docker is an open platform to build, ship, and run any application, anywhere. In this hands-on tutorial, you will learn advanced Docker concepts, and see how to deploy and scale applications using Docker Swarm mode clustering abilities and other open source tools of the Docker ecosystem.
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Overview</strong>

<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Getting started
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Pre-requirements
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- VM environment
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Our sample application
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Running the application
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Identifying bottlenecks
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Scaling out
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- SwarmKit
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Creating our first Swarm
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Running our first Swarm service
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Our app on Swarm
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Deploying a local registry
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Overlay networks
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Operating the Swarm
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Breaking into an overlay network
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Rolling updates
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Centralized logging
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Setting up ELK to store container logs
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Workshop Requires:</strong>

<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Laptop with an SSH client
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- on Linux, OS X, FreeBSD... you are probably all set
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- on Windows, get putty, Git BASH, or MobaXterm
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- A web browser
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Some Docker knowledge (but that's OK if you're not a Docker expert!)
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Nice-to-haves:</strong>

<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- GitHub account (if you want to fork the repo; also used to join Gitter)
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Gitter account (to join the conversation during the workshop)
<br/>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
- Docker Hub account
